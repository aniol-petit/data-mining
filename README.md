# data-mining

## Overview
Notebooks for a data mining course. Each lab focuses on a specific topic with compact, runnable examples. For full details, see the notebooks.

## Labs
- ps01_02_data_preparation_103_AniolPetit.ipynb
  - Load and explore datasets
  - Clean data: missing values, outliers, duplicates
  - Transformations: scaling/normalization, encoding, feature selection

- ps03_near_duplicates_103_AniolPetit.ipynb
  - Shingling and Jaccard similarity
  - MinHash signatures and LSH for candidate generation
  - Detect and evaluate near-duplicate pairs

- ps04_association_rules_103_AniolPetit.ipynb
  - Mine frequent itemsets (support thresholds)
  - Generate association rules (confidence, lift)
  - Prune and interpret rules

- ps05_content_based_recsys.ipynb
  - Build item profiles (e.g., TF‑IDF/features)
  - Compute similarities and recommend similar items
  - Evaluate recommendations

- ps06_item_based_recsys.ipynb
  - Item–item collaborative filtering
  - Similarity matrix and neighborhood selection
  - Rating prediction and evaluation

- ps07_outlier_analysis_103_AniolPetit.ipynb
  - Statistical (z‑score/IQR) and distance-based methods
  - Density methods (e.g., LOF) and visualization
  - Thresholding and evaluation

- ps08_data_streams_103_AniolPetit.ipynb
